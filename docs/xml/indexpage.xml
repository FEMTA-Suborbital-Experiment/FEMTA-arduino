<para>The HSCM Ambient Pressure sensor obtains a reading of the pressure and temperature in its environment (assumed to be in air). The barometer is valid from 0 psi to a maximum of 100 psi (depending on the type used). However, the precision at vacuum is questionable and thus not used for flight state detection in the higher altitudes (&gt;150,000 ft).</para>
<para>Make sure to include the read() function in the loop(). Then call the temperature() and pressure() to obtain the temperature and pressure in C and psi, respectively. </para>
